And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
In my mind, in my head
This is where, we all came from
In my mind, in my head
This is where, we all came from
And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
In my mind, in my head
This is where, we all came from
In my mind, in my head
This is where, we all came from
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
